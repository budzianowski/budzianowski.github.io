The personal website of Pawel Budzianowski. Source code for <https://budzianowski.github.io/>.

The website was built based on a great page of [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.github.io) using GitHub pages, Jekyll and the very cool *Minimal Mistakes* theme (with minor tweaks) from [Michael Rose](https://twitter.com/mmistakes).

I'm a co-founder of [K-Scale Labs](https://kscale.dev/) where we are building general-purpose robots (GPRs) to bring embodied intelligence into the real. I also created and co-lecture the joint NLP course for ML Master's programs at [Warsaw University](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/en/machine-learning-new-field-masters-programs) and [Jagiellonian University](https://gmum.net/). I am passionate about everything that is related to applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

I used to lead the ML team at [PolyAI](https://www.polyai.com/) working on conversational AI in research and production. I did my PhD in [Dialogue Systems Group](https://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/people/) at Cambridge University working on long-term conversational agents jointly supervised by [prof. Rich Turner](https://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) and [prof. Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/). I also had a chance to work with [prof. Milica Gašić](https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/dialog-systems-and-machine-learning.html).

Prior to that, I was working on training deep belief networks using high-temperature expansion being supervised by [prof. Rich Turner](https://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome). For my bachelor, I graduated in mathematics from [Adam Mickiewicz University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz_University_in_Pozna%C5%84).
